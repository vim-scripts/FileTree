A file tree exporer based on the tree.vim script.
Since version 1.0 it has CD command and directory stack similar to shell's one.
You can use RFileTree command to split it on the right side of the window or similar LFileTree,BFileTree,TFileTree commands. FileTree command uses default values for placing window.

I will gladly accept any \(comments\|bug reports\|request for feature\)\+
